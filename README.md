<strong><h3>Hiverr.io is YOUR home in web3.</h3></strong>

<p>Connect your web3 wallet and get started! One platform for posting jobs, finding jobs, networking, offering services, or simply earning crypto for completing quick tasks. Hiverr.io combines the best features of 5 different centralized web2 platforms into one web3 platform that does it all.</p>

<h3>Web3 Networking</h3>
Connect with others in the web3 space. Find startups, join communities, and network with others who are passionate about web3 and the future of not only how we work, but how we see our future becoming more decentralized, open source, and creator-driven. Centralized platforms are riddled with paywalls in order for people to connect. Hiverr eliminates those barriers and is a place where everyone can directly connect.

<h3>Freelancer Marketplace</h3>
The hiring process has stalled as remote work and freelancers have become more important than ever. Our blockchain-powered platform solves the problems that plague the centralized web2 freelancing industry.

<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
<h2>Hiverr.io brings together the best of both traditional business and agile crypto models.</h2> 

<strong>At Hiverr the process is simple: </strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Freelancers and clients can access the Hiverr.io app using their crypto wallets, with scheduled access for WalletConnect and Solana and Hiverr login, a proprietary solution.</li>
 	<li>Upon signup, users can either choose to be a client, freelancer, or both. Once an account is set up, users can then create or apply for jobs, offer services, or start working on any microtasking jobs on the supported chain.</li>
 	<li>The microtasks and freelancer services are registered on-chain. The payment for microtasks and services bought from freelancers are deposited in an escrow account, commencing the collaboration.</li>
 	<li>Payments are automated and happen quickly and securely via smart contracts, making actions irreversible, immutable, and tamper-proof.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The MAJOR Problem with Web2</h1>

<p>Web2 platforms are a concentration of power and decision-making in a centralized system. They raise commissions on freelancers, cutting into the profits of users of the platform, which forces everyone to work longer to make the same amount as they did before. There is often no community debate, no transparency, and no bargaining to ensure a fair outcome for all.</p>

<h4>Difficult to find the right professionals</h4>
<h4>Communication and networking barriers</h4>
<h4>Prevalence of fraud sellers and fake job postings</h4>
<h4>High charges and additional costs</h4>
